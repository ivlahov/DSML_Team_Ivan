    "We aim to **predict the duration (in minutes)** of a ride-hailing trip in Chicago using publicly available data. This can help:\n",

    "- Improve estimated time of arrival (ETA) systems\n",
    "- Support city-level mobility planning\n",
    "- Optimize dispatching and routing algorithms for fleet operators\n",
